# Hit Discovery Mode
#
# Operational philosophy:
# - Tolerate high OOD (QSAR applicability less critical)
# - Emphasize novelty and chemical diversity
# - Accept that QSAR is directional rather than quantitative
# - Longer exploration runs before switching to exploit
# - Lower confidence requirements

run:
  mode: "hit_discovery"
